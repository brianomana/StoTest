# StoTest

StoTest is a Visual Studio Code extension designed for use in St. Olaf College CS courses. The extension offers a simple UI for students to setup and run GoogleTest testing files with little unit testing background knowledge. The intent is this tool will aid students as they complete assignments and encourage test-driven development practices. We are also begining development to equip TAs with the tools they need to use StoTest to grade student assignments. This will be done by leveraging StoGrade, the existing grader toolkit software at St. Olaf.
